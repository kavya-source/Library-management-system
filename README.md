# Library-management-system
The system issues books and keeps record of the available books as the books are issued and returned using three files “user_details.txt”, “book_detail.txt”, “record.txt”. It creates an account with an unique ID through which each user can access the books of the library. Also, this system keeps track of the date of issue and date of return and charges fine for delayed return accordingly. The software uses command line interface.
